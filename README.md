# BAN6420-Module4 Assingment visualizing the Netflix dataset
Instructions on accessing and interpreting your Python and R code:

Python code:

Import the prepared Netflix_shows_movies dataset

Read the Netflix dataset CSV file
Import libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
View the first few rows of the data to explore the data
Summarize the data showing general information such as: data types, non-null values, and memory usage
Display summary statistics (for numeric and object columns)
Filter movies and extract duration in minutes
Round up genre duration column to the nearest whole number
Create bar chart showing distribution of ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13, etc.)
Create bar chart for most watched genres by total duration (using 'duration' in minutes) using Matplotlib and Seaborn

R code:
Load necessary libraries such as readr, plotly and ggplot2
Read the Netflix_shows_movies. data file
View the first few rows of the data to explore the data
Filter the data for Movies and remove rows with missing duration or genre
Extract numeric duration, split genres, aggregate total duration by genre, sort top ten genres by total duration, and create bar chart using ggplot2.
